# Automated logistics' GitOps
This repo is a simple version of the kind of setups that we in AL use for deployment at a single site. 


# The Task

The task is simple:
* Familiarize yourself with the resources defined. And then be prepared to talk about the solution as you see it.

Please don't spend time on trying to deploy the resources or really anything else.
Topics we will be covering: CI/CD, Kubernetes, GitOps, Helm, and more.
